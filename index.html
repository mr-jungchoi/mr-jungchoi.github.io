    <p>Foodology is based on the idea that what you eat not only affects your body, but it also plays a significant role in how you feel. Let us help you figure out how your diet is affecting your cognition and your behavior.</p>

  <h2>About Foodology</h2>
  <p>
    <div>
    Foodology was started by Chef and Psychologist Jung U Choi who was curious about the affects of a person's nutrition on their mood and behavior. It is already generally excepted that other aspects of our daily lives play a large role in our psychology. Sleep for example is a major field of study within psychology and some psychologists even believe that a lack of sleep can lead to psychosis (think about what would happen if you started dreaming while you were awake).

    So why is it that more people do not understand the relationship between our food and our minds. Everyone has to eat; it is what keeps us alive and gives us energy to get through the day. Yet, most people are more preoccupied by how food affects the way our bodies <em>look</em> rather than how it affects the way we <strong>feel</strong> and <strong>think</strong>. The basic theory behind the idea of foodology is that our brain needs fuel to function and we get that fuel from our food. So what would happen if we weren't getting the correct nutrients for our brains to function properly? We know that our diets can lead to physical illness so is it possible that it could also lead to mental illness? Does food play a more significant role in our psychology and if so, how do we feed our brains? Let's find out together.

  <p>This website is for Cornell University's Food and Brand Lab. I like this website because it is easy to navigate and it seems like it fairly organized despite the amount of content that it contains. I also like that it has a search bar that allows you to search for different articles and pages hosted by the website. I can't really say anything bad about the design of the website, but I personally would perfer it if the navigation links were on the left or right hand margin rather than at the top. Regarding the content of the website, I wish there was a section dedicated to what foods can help with certain brain functions.</p>
